    "We are entrepreneurs who went through fundraising & startup building. We know from experience how difficult the path can be and how lonely the journey can feel at times. That is why we decided to help small companies & early-stage startups in the areas that were the most troublesome and cash-burning for us.",
    "Our goal is to deliver good-quality services at reasonable prices to keep your runway going until you raise another round of financing.",
    "We work with a network of hungry and talented software developers; we tech-screen all of them, so that we are confident in their skills.",
    "If you are looking to scale your team, quickly ship features, optimize your software development and its costs, or just test hypotheses, let's chat!"
